Docomo Ipadic Analyzer Testing with a Twitter tweet document feed from a file stream and composite document write to
  a CouchDB instance.


These tests are recommended to be run in as a projected in an IntelliJ Idea environment.

IpadicTest.java is the an algorithm to provide a comparison test between a list of Lucene Analyzers

The IpadicCompositeAnalyzer is the analyzer used to develop Japanese tokens at docomo.

The Ipadic Analyzers are included in the igo_ipadic_analyzer.jar file in the lib directory

the ipadic dictionary location is one potential bug to check for installation issues,
but I do not anticipate this as a problem


 ReadGZip.java is an implementation for reading GZip files containing Twitter tweet data and publishing
 the tweet documents with tokenized text to a CouchDB instance. The location uri of a gzip tweet files
 and the ektorp connection parameters are necessary to implement this demo.
